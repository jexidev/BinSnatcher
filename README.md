# BinSnatcher
Snatch .bin files from game downloads and organize your setup folders—gamer-first automation.
# BinSnatcher

**BinSnatcher** is a gamer-first PowerShell utility that hunts down `.bin` files from messy game downloads and moves them into your setup folder: fast, safe, and customisable.

Whether you're 1-by-1 direct downloading (for some mad reason) or a mass downloader/auto-extraction tools like JDownloader2, BinSnatcher helps clean up your install folders with minimal effort.

## Work In Progress

This tool is currently in active development. The current version is a functional script with basic file handling. Planned features include:

- GUI interface for folder selection and options  
- Error handling and logging  
- Smart filters (e.g., exclude folders, preview files)  
- Optional copy vs move toggle  
- Donation link for support

## Why BinSnatcher?

As a gamer, I got tired of manually moving `.bin` files after every download. So I built a tool that does it for me—and now I’m sharing it with the community.

Yes, similar tools exist. But BinSnatcher is built with a **gamer-first attitude**, lightweight design, and a focus on real-world workflows.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jexidev/BinSnatcher.git
2. Open the script in PowerShell or VS Code.

3. Customize your source and destination folders inside the script.

4. Run the script and let BinSnatcher do the work.

Note: This is a PowerShell-based utility. Make sure you have execution permissions enabled. You may need to open PowerShell as admin and run:
